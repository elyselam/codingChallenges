// Write a function coinFlip that returns at random either 'heads' or 'tails'
// BONUS: Can you devise a way to investigate if your function produces 'heads' and 'tails' with a roughly 50/50 split?

// random creates a number between zero and one,
// multiplying that by two gives a number between zero and two

// The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0–1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range — which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.



function coinFlip() {
	//returns 0
	//return 1
